## Pale-Moon- 2025

Archived versions - System Requirements - Release NotesThe second feature that makes Pale Moon so popular is the fact that it still supports various old Firefox add-ons (most of which are no longer supported by the newer version of Firefox, and had to be built from the ground up to make them work). To be more precise, it offers support for XUL, XPCOM, and NPAPI plugins, the so-called “legacy” Firefox extensions.

Even if we were to disregard all the aforementioned features, Pale Moon would still be a good browser. Because the browser does not bundle some of the many irrelevant bits and bobs found in the old Firefox engine, it’s incredibly fast and very stable. Install it on a modern machine and you can definitely see a slight improvement in speed when compared to your modern browser, but the beauty of Pale Moon is that it also works on older machines with older versions of Windows.
